/**
 * AssemblyScript Transform to strip @inline decorators
 *
 * This transform removes @inline decorators from the AST during test compilation,
 * allowing coverage instrumentation to properly track function calls.
 *
 * Production code uses @inline decorators for performance. When functions are inlined,
 * coverage instrumentation can't track their execution.
 *
 * How this transform works:
 * - Hooks into the AssemblyScript compiler's `afterParse` lifecycle
 * - Walks through all parsed source files before compilation begins
 * - Processes any statement that has decorators (kind-agnostic)
 * - Filters out DecoratorNode entries where decoratorKind === DecoratorKind.Inline
 * - Sets decorators to null if no decorators remain after filtering
 *
 * USAGE:
 * Add to AssemblyScript compiler flags:
 *   --transform ./src/transforms/strip-inline.mjs
 *
 * @see https://www.assemblyscript.org/compiler.html#transforms
 * @see https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/blob/main/src/ast.ts
